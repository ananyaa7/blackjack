############### Our Blackjack House Rules #####################

## The deck is unlimited in size. 
## There are no jokers. 
## The Jack/Queen/King all count as 10.
## The the Ace can count as 11 or 1.
## Use the following list as the deck of cards:
## cards = [11, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10]
## The cards in the list have equal probability of being drawn.
## Cards are not removed from the deck as they are drawn.
## The computer is the dealer.

##################### Hints #####################

#Hint 1: Go to this website and try out the Blackjack game: 
#   https://games.washingtonpost.com/games/blackjack/
#Then try out the completed Blackjack project here: 
#   https://appbrewery.github.io/python-day11-demo/

#Hint 2: Read this breakdown of program requirements: 
#   http://listmoz.com/view/6h34DJpvJBFVRlZfJvxF
#Then try to create your own flowchart for the program.

#Hint 3: Download and read this flow chart I've created: 
#   https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1rDkiHCrhaf9eX7u7yjM1qwSuyEk-rPnt

#Hint 4: Create a deal_card() function that uses the List below to *return* a random card.
#11 is the Ace.
import random
from art import logo
import os
cards = [11, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10]
def deal_card(cards):
    return random.choice(cards)

#Hint 5: Deal the user and computer 2 cards each using deal_card() and append().


#tryung to see if commit works

#Hint 6: Create a function called calculate_score() that takes a List of cards as input 
#and returns the score. 
#Look up the sum() function to help you do this.
def calculate_score(tmplst):
    tmplst.sort()
    #Hint 7: Inside calculate_score() check for a blackjack (a hand with only 2 cards: ace + 10) and return 0 instead of the actual score. 0 will represent a blackjack in our game.

    if tmplst[0]==11 and tmplst[1]==10 and len(tmplst)==2:
        #its a blackjack
        return 0
    #Hint 8: Inside calculate_score() check for an 11 (ace). If the score is already over 21, remove the 11 and replace it with a 1. You might need to look up append() and remove().

    if 11 in tmplst:
        if sum(tmplst)>21:
            tmplst.remove(11)
            tmplst.append(1)
    

    return sum(tmplst)

    while not is_game_over:
        user_score = calculate_score(user_cards)

        else:
        #Hint 10: If the game has not ended, ask the user if they want to draw another card. If yes, then use the deal_card() function to add another card to the user_cards List. If no, then the game has ended.
            user_should_deal = input("Type 'y' to get another card, type 'n' to pass: ")

    print(f"   Computer's final hand: {computer_cards}, final score: {computer_score}")

def compare(user_score, computer_score):
  #Bug fix. If you and the computer are both over, you lose.
  if user_score > 21 and computer_score > 21:
    return "You went over. You lose 😤"
  if user_score == computer_score:
    return "Draw 🙃"
  elif computer_score == 0:
    return "Lose, opponent has Blackjack 😱"
  elif user_score == 0:

#Hint 14: Ask the user if they want to restart the game. If they answer yes, clear the console and start a new game of blackjack and show the logo from art.py.
